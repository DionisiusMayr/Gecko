# Getting Steam Games
In order to get the JSON file of steam games, I used another github. 
```sh
gh repo clone FronkonGames/Steam-Games-Scraper
```
After cloning the repo, follow the README to get the JSON file.

# Getting Steam Profiles
First, check the SteamProfileScraper.py file and adjust it for your own personal steam API key. You can acquire one at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
Next, run the python file with
```sh
python3 SteamProfileScraper.py
```
